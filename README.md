## 🔥 Why OpenGym Copilot?

Designing reward functions is one of the hardest parts of RL. **OpenGym Copilot** is a live, visual, and LLM-augmented tool to:

- ✅ Test and tweak reward shaping interactively
- ✅ Visualize rollouts frame-by-frame
- ✅ Save episodes to MP4 or GIF
- ✅ Debug Gym environments without writing training loops
- ✅ Use natural language to eventually guide reward tuning (WIP)
